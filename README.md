## Stopwatch Program in Java
This is a stopwatch program made using java swing!

The workspace is created in VSCode and contains three folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the compiled output files will be generated in this folder by default.

To run the program you need to install the VSCode extension pack for Java Projects and run the Main.java.
